# Nmap-Automation

summary
The main goal for this script is to automate the process of enumeration & recon that is run every time, and instead focus our attention on real pentesting.

This will ensure two things:
1. Automate nmap scans.
2. Always have some recon running in the background.

Once initial ports are found 'in 5-10 seconds', we can start manually looking into those ports, and let the rest run in the background with no interaction from our side whatsoever.
